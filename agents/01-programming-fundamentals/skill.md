# Agent 1: Programming Fundamentals & Language Selection

## Overview
This agent covers the foundational concepts and tools needed before diving into backend development. It focuses on selecting the right programming language, understanding package management, and mastering version control systems.

## Agent Purpose
- Guide developers through programming language selection
- Establish proficiency with chosen language and its ecosystem
- Master version control and collaboration tools
- Set up development environment and toolchain

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Language Selection & Proficiency
- Help developers choose appropriate backend language
- Provide language-specific learning paths
- Cover language fundamentals beyond basic syntax
- Recommend frameworks and libraries by language

### 2. Package Management
- Understand dependency management concepts
- Learn package manager specific to chosen language
- Manage versioning and compatibility
- Handle conflicts and resolution strategies

### 3. Version Control Systems
- Master Git fundamentals and workflows
- Learn GitHub (or alternative) collaboration
- Implement branching strategies (Git Flow, GitHub Flow)
- Practice code review and pull request workflows

### 4. Development Environment
- IDE/Editor setup and configuration
- Build tools and compilation processes
- Debugging strategies
- Project structure and organization

## Learning Progression

### Phase 1: Language Selection (1-2 weeks)
1. Evaluate use cases for different languages
2. Consider team expertise and project requirements
3. Make informed language choice
4. Set up basic development environment

### Phase 2: Language Fundamentals (2-4 weeks)
1. Master language syntax and semantics
2. Understand language-specific paradigms
3. Learn standard library
4. Build simple CLI applications

### Phase 3: Package Management (1 week)
1. Install and configure package manager
2. Understand dependency specification
3. Create and publish packages
4. Handle version constraints

### Phase 4: Version Control (2-3 weeks)
1. Git basics and local repository
2. Remote repositories and GitHub
3. Branching and merging workflows
4. Collaboration and pull requests

### Phase 5: Development Workflow (1-2 weeks)
1. IDE shortcuts and productivity tips
2. Build automation and task runners
3. Testing and debugging
4. Project initialization and scaffolding

## Recommended Language Choices

### Personal Recommendations (High Priority)
- **JavaScript/Node.js** - Versatile, full-stack, excellent ecosystem
- **Go** - Modern, efficient, built-in concurrency, cloud-native

### Alternative Options (Medium Priority)
- **Python** - Readable, versatile, strong ecosystem
- **Java** - Enterprise-grade, robust, mature
- **C#** - Modern, Microsoft ecosystem, .NET platform
- **PHP** - Web-focused, easy hosting, large community
- **Ruby** - Developer-friendly, Rails framework, rapid development

### Emerging Option (Lower Priority)
- **Rust** - Systems programming, performance, safety

## Tools & Technologies Covered

### IDEs & Editors
- VS Code (recommended for most languages)
- Language-specific IDEs (PyCharm, IntelliJ, RubyMine, etc.)
- Vim/Neovim (for advanced users)
- Sublime Text

### Version Control
- Git (distributed version control)
- GitHub (repository hosting)
- GitLab (alternative, more features)
- Bitbucket (Atlassian solution)

### Package Managers by Language
- **Node.js**: npm, yarn, pnpm
- **Python**: pip, conda, poetry
- **Java**: Maven, Gradle
- **C#**: NuGet
- **PHP**: Composer
- **Ruby**: RubyGems, Bundler
- **Go**: Go Modules (built-in)
