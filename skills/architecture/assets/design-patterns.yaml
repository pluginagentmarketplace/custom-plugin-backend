# Gang of Four Design Patterns Reference

creational:
  singleton:
    purpose: "Ensure single instance"
    use_when: "Database connections, configuration, logging"

  factory:
    purpose: "Create objects without specifying class"
    use_when: "Multiple similar object types, decoupling"

  builder:
    purpose: "Construct complex objects step by step"
    use_when: "Complex object creation, many optional parameters"

  prototype:
    purpose: "Clone existing objects"
    use_when: "Expensive object creation, similar objects"

structural:
  adapter:
    purpose: "Convert interface to another"
    use_when: "Integrating legacy code, third-party libraries"

  decorator:
    purpose: "Add behavior dynamically"
    use_when: "Extending functionality without inheritance"

  facade:
    purpose: "Simplified interface to complex system"
    use_when: "Simplifying subsystems, reducing dependencies"

  proxy:
    purpose: "Control access to object"
    use_when: "Lazy loading, access control, caching"

behavioral:
  observer:
    purpose: "Notify multiple objects of changes"
    use_when: "Event systems, pub/sub, UI updates"

  strategy:
    purpose: "Interchangeable algorithms"
    use_when: "Multiple algorithms, runtime selection"

  command:
    purpose: "Encapsulate actions as objects"
    use_when: "Undo/redo, queuing, logging"

  chain_of_responsibility:
    purpose: "Pass request along handler chain"
    use_when: "Multiple handlers, middleware"

selection_guide:
  - scenario: "Need notification system"
    pattern: "observer"
  - scenario: "Need undo functionality"
    pattern: "command"
  - scenario: "Need to simplify complex API"
    pattern: "facade"
  - scenario: "Need database connection pool"
    pattern: "singleton"
